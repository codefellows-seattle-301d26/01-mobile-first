## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

The problem domain is to create a blog application that is responsive on mobile and also adapts to larger screens such as desktops.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

In order for a user to build this site they would first need to understand mobile responsive design as well as SMACSS. They would also need to read through this documentation to get an idea of what to expect. They would need to apply SMACSS to CSS rules.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

This application is designed to mainly be used on mobile devices, but is adaptable to on desktop and other viewports. The meta tag "viewport" is what achieves that adaptibility. The libraries we used were normalize.css, and the languages we used were CSS and HTML.

## Change Log
