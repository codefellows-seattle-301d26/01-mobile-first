## Overview
This is a blog and our problem domain is to make it so that a user is able to view the blog and have it scale to their mobile device. 
As a user, I want to be able to view the blog not only on a mobile device, but a desktop. I would want to be able to see the content adjust to my mobile device, but also adjust to my desktop so it is viewable. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user is going to want to make sure that the css can adjust its content accordingly based on the viewport so it is viewer friendly. 
The user is going to want to organize their files in their css through the base, layouts, and modules so it is easier to read the code and cleaner. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
CSS, HTML, Live-Server. We got an icon from icomoon for the hamburger menu.
